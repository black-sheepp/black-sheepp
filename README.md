# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shivam, a passionate developer with a love for building web applications. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share my journey and showcase my skills in web development.

## About Me

I'm a web developer with a deep appreciation for clean and elegant code. My journey in the world of programming started with a fascination for creating interactive and user-friendly websites. Over the years, I've honed my skills and gained experience in various web technologies. I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges in the ever-evolving world of web development.

## My Skills

- **HTML**: Creating the structure and foundation of web pages is where it all begins. I'm well-versed in HTML and can transform ideas into functional web interfaces.

- **CSS**: I have a keen eye for design and a strong grasp of CSS to bring those ideas to life. Styling and responsive design are my specialties.

- **JavaScript**: The magic behind interactivity and user experience. I write clean and efficient JavaScript code to create dynamic web applications.

- **React.js**: I love building responsive and dynamic user interfaces with React. It's my go-to library for crafting engaging web applications.

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript is a game-changer. I use Node.js to create efficient and scalable backend systems for my projects.

- **Express.js**: Building web applications with Node.js is made even better with Express.js. I can create robust APIs and server routes using this framework.

- **MongoDB**: Storing data is crucial, and MongoDB is my choice for NoSQL databases. I design data models and build scalable databases for various applications.
